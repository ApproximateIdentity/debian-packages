PACKAGING INSTRUCTIONS
======================

Here are the basic steps necessary to produce and update a new python debian
package or update for a new upstream release:

1) Get a copy of the original source and store it in the current directory as
`$package-$vers.tar.gz`. This can be created by running

    $ python setup.py sdist

in the original source release.

2) Create the necessary debian files by running the following command:

	$ py2dsc -m 'Thomas Nyberg <tomnyberg@gmail.com>' $package-$vers.tar.gz 

3) Copy/replace the generated files with our own custom files by running:

	$ cp -v debian/* deb_dist/$package-$vers/debian

4) If this is a version update, you need the original source of the _previous_
version. It should be called `$package_$~vers.orig.tar.gz` (where $~vers is
supposed to indicate the previous version number). Save this version inside the
deb_dist/ folder.

5) You also need to copy the _previous_ release's changelog file to the
`deb_dist/$package-$vers/debian/` folder as well.

6) Go into the `deb_dist/$package-$vers/` folder and update the changelog by
running the following:

    $ dch -v $vers-1

7) Finally run the following inside the `deb_dist/$package-$vers/` folder:

    $ debuild -uc -us
