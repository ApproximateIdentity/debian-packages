* The process of updating packaging here seems wrong. Currently I'm basically
regenerating the initial package for each version and then changing the
changelog. It seems like what I should really be doing is generating a patch
and updating the old package from there on. See here for details:

The previous deb/dsc files in the repo were deleted...this seems wrong and
maybe has to do with the lack of a patch.
